    <p>Hello, my name is Liam Rottkov and I want to become a developer because I enjoy working with computers and using them to solve problems. In 2017, I graduated from the University of Southern Maine with a degree in Business Administration and have since been working in the real estate industry. I made the decision to attend Coding Temple I want to learn to code and establish a new career for myself. My first experience with a computer was nearly 20 years ago and I haven't stopped using them. When I'm not coding I enjoy spending time with my family, friends, roomates, and our three dogs and one cat. Some of my interests include music, movies, games, books, art, animals, sports, and traveling. I look forward to learning as much as possible in the coming weeks.</p>
